  + This directory contains blog posts in org format
  + They are published using org-mode, from here to ~/_posts~ as html
    * See also settings for publishing in ~config.org~ file
  + Templates are found in ~template_post.org~ and ~template_header.org~
- [2021-10-06 Wed] THE WORKFLOW, when having math or Latex in the post
  1. Write the post with normal org-mode syntax and the Jekyll naming convention ~YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.org~ and save it in this ~_org~ directory
     * Some simple Latex is recognized automatically, e.g. subscripts L_1, and Greek characters \alpha
     * More involved math can be included inside of dollar-signs like this: $y=x^2$
     * To publish the math correctly it is important that  ~:body-only  nil~ is set in the Emacs config file for publishing, otherwise "$" is published as "\("
     * It is apparently not possible to both publish correct math and font-matter, it is either-or and determined by the ~:body-only~ flag being ~t~ or ~nil~ 
  2. Write a header file with the same name as the post, but prefixed by ~header_~, and save in same directory as the post
     * This file contains /only/ the font-matter, enclosed between sets of three dashes, see ~template_header.org~ for an example
  3. Publish the post to html with the shortcuts ~C-c C-e P f~, i.e. only the file (to not mess up all the other posts)
     * The post is now ready to be inspected on the local host for formatting, typos, etc
     * Once all changes have been made, proceed to the next, tedious, manual step
  4. Manually copy and past the content of the header file into the beginning of published html file
     * Verify that this looks correct on localhost
  5. Commit and push to GitHub
     * Wait a few minutes then inspect the results
- [2021-10-06 Wed] WORKFLOW for md files
  1. Just write the post as a markdown file and place it directly in ~_posts~
    * Fontmatter should be formatted with three dashes as normally
  2. No org-mode publishing or manual steps involved, that is only for posts with math or Latex symbols
