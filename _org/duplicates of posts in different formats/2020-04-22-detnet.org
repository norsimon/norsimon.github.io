** Short take
- Hourglass-shaped network for detection of spots/foci/particles in cells
- Based on Deconvolution network with the following changes
  + Reduced number of feature maps
  + Reduces size of receptive field (two instead of five poolings)
  + No long-range skip connections (detailed boundary information is irrelevant)
  + Use residual blocks instead of convolution (to reduce issue of vanishing gradient)
  + Use instance- instead of batch-normalisation (because little training data)
  + Use bilinear upsampling instead of transposed convolutions (expanding path)
  + 17k parameters instead of U-net's 1.9M
  + Use soft Dice loss (performs implicit class balancing and penalizes easy samples)
  + Use early stopping

** Miscellaneous
- Details
  + AMSGrad optimizer
  + in-house hyperparameter optimization framework HyperHyper
- Quotes
  + domain adapted Deconvolution Network
  + can be trained with only a few ground truth annotations
  + benchmarked using data from the ISBI Particle Tracking Challenge
  + including particles with different shapes (round and elongated)
  + when using a standard Cross-Entropy loss, training was not successful due to the heavy class imbalance
  + the F1 score can be signiﬁcantly improved by optimizing the shift a ∈ R of the sigmoid function of the neural network
  + The assignment between particle detections and ground truth was determined by the Munkres algorithm with a maximal gating distance of 5 pixels.
