* What is this post about?
- Notes from reading the 2021 paper
  + "Productivity curve and social network analysis in science megaproject management"
  + by Phillip M. Bentley
  + https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/ac314c
* Short take
- Bottom-up study of a scientific facility heavy in instrumentation, in terms of productivity and inefficiencies in management
-  
* What do they do?
* How do they do it?
* Why do they do it?
* Conclusions and open questions
* Misc notes
- Uniqueness bias :: the desire to implement bespoke solutions instead of using established and more standard ones.
  + Often leads to more expensive and less efficient implementations
  + Reminds me of Hamming's warning, in his 1995 lectures (The Art of doing Science and Engineering),  against using custom chips for computing
  + "It is immensely ego gratifying to have special purpose chips for your special job, but there are very high costs associated with them"
- Forced Distribution Rating System (FDRS) :: When grades are distributed but there are fixed quotas for each grade, that way enforcing a pre-determined distribution
