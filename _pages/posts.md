A collection of notes, mainly from reading papers, sorted by date of entry.  
If you want, sort the posts by [tags](/tags/) or by [category](/categories/).








<!-- posts layout takes care of all of this:
<ul>
	{% for post in site.posts %}
	<li>
		<h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
		<p>{{ post.date }}</p>
		<p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>               
	</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
-->
