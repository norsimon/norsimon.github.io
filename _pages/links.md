outcommented text
Is this better handled using tags and simple adding as posts? Would be easy to search and make it easy to add some comments to the usage, without being an actual review. Would I use it myself?

## Image Analysis
### Segmentation
- [Allen Cell Structure Segmenter](https://www.allencell.org/segmenter.html)  
Python-based open source toolkit for 3D segmentation of intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images.
Brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows. From Allen Institute.

- [cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation](http://www.cellpose.org)  
Python based. Online demonstration of segmentation of 2D images of cells. Drag and drop for segmentation of fluorescence, bright-field, and electron microscopy images. Animal and plant cells. Quite impressive. Code available on GitHub. Paper on ArXiv. From Janelia.


## Online learning

### Coding, tools
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu)  
Teaches you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more! From MIT.

### Deep Learning
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3](https://course.fast.ai/index.html)  
Requires that you can code and have access to a GPU, but not much else. Uses Python and PyTorch, no Keras of TensorFlow here. Free and without adds, the way a good online course should be.
From [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) ("Making neural nets uncool again"). 

- [Deep Learning from the Foundations](https://course.fast.ai/part2)  
The second part of [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai)'s course. Introduces Swift for TensorFlow. Focuses on foundations, as opposed to the practical aspects.
