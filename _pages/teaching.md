I teach image and data analysis at a range of levels from introductory courses for life-scientists to advanced level for professional image analysts.  
In introductory courses the focus is on fundamental concepts, illustrated with hands-on exercises using open-source software, e.g. ImageJ/Fiji.  
Advanced courses focus more on new software tools, probabilistic inference, and recent developments in deep learning for image analysis.  
Throughout, reproducibility and good coding habits are emphasized.
