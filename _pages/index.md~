Welcome to my scientific home page!  
I work at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the Scientific Center for Optical and Electron Microscopy ([ScopeM](http://www.scopem.ethz.ch)) together with a small group of Image and Data Analysts ([IDA](http://www.let-your-data-speak.com)) focusing on image-data from the lifesciences.

## Why the raccoon?
We chose the raccoon as logo for our group for three reasons

1. We like it --- it has a face
2. It is easy to threshold
3. It has abilities we strive to emulate: 
  - *"Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years"* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon)
