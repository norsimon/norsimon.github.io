Welcome to my personal scientific home page!  
I work at Harvard Medical School where I am currenlty building a group of bioimage analysts.
We apply classic methods and artificial intelligence to analyze image-data from the lifesciences and beyond.

## Why the raccoon?
We chose the raccoon as logo for our group for three reasons

1. We like it --- it has a face
2. It is easy to threshold
3. It has abilities we strive to emulate: 
  - *"Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years"* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon)
